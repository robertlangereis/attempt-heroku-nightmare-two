# comic-scraper
This a small node-js function that scrapes a comic, cuts it up an resizes it to the desired format (in this case: landscape to verticle) and pushes it to a mobile phone number via whatsapp. 

With special thanks to oscarmorrison for his "nightmare-heroku" repo setup (https://github.com/oscarmorrison/nightmare-heroku)
